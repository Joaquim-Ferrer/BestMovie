      "review/text: Well, I've heard about this one since it was new, so I'm not sure why it took me so long to get around to it. I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Idgie Threadgoode (Mary Stuart Masterson, Joon of Benny &) lost her older brother to a train accident when she was a little girl. She had been his favorite, and she adored him. It came very hard for her. She grew up rather wild and self-willed, which was not appropriate for a girl in the south in the 1920s.<br /><br />Her story is told to Evelyn Couch (Kathy Bates) by Ninny Threadgoode (Jessica Tandy), who is now a very old lady in the same retirement center as Evelyn's husband's aunt (or great-aunt?). Evelyn keeps being thrown out of her husband's aunt's room every time he goes visiting, and so she struck up a conversation with Ninny Threadgoode, who told her all about Idgie.<br /><br />She could drink and swear and gamble and fight as well as the guys, and wore men's clothes much of the time. One summer, her mother invited her cousin Ruth (Mary-Louisa Parker) to spend the summer with them, hoping the very proper Ruth would be a good influence on Idgie. Predictably, she was a \"bad\" influence on Ruth instead.<br /><br />But Ruth got married. When Idgie went to visit her in her new home, she also had a black eye and bruised cheek. Idgie is irate, of course, and threatens Ruth's SOB of a husband that she will kill him if he hurts Ruth again. Eventually, when she finds out Ruth is pregnant and scared to death of her husband, Idgie takes a couple of strong arms with her and moves Ruth back to her place.<br /><br />The title of the movie refers to the Whistle Stop Cafe that Idgie and Ruth opened to support themselves after Ruth's baby is born and named after Idgie's lost big brother. There's some considerable hassle over the fact that her friend Sipsey (Cecily Tyson) and her son Big George run a barbecue in the back of the cafe. Segregation was still big, and in fact the KKK got involved.<br /><br />Bare outline here: Ruth's ex-husband was missing for some five years, and then his truck was dredged out of the river. Because someone remembered hearing Idgie threaten him, she and Big George stand trial for murder, even though the body was never found. If you want to know how it turns out, you'll have to get the movie and see for yourself.\n",
